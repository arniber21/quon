# RAP Table I regression methodology (#111)

External regression anchor for the zoned NA backend (#107), reproducing one

Sec. VI-B. Companion to

and

below.

## Two-phase HITL plan

| Phase | Who | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 (this doc / agent-implementable)** | Agent | Land the circuit, pinned target, this doc, and a metric **dump** test that records agnostic vs aware rearrangement steps/time without failing CI on mismatch. |
| **2a (#297, agent-implementable)** | Agent | Implement [RAP]'s Eqs. (3)-(5) A* heuristic so the aware search actually completes instead of always falling back — see [Phase 2a status](#phase-2a-status-297-heuristic-search-closes-the-fallback-gap). Still does **not** flip the enforcement flag. |
| **2b (human then enforce)** | Human sign-off, then agent | Review whether the Phase 2a numbers are a *mechanism-legitimate* reproduction (not just numerically close by accident) and whether the remaining gap to the paper's 9-step/1.6ms row is understood/acceptable. Only then flip on hard tolerance asserts (`QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE=1`, below). |

Phase 1 deliberately does not hard-assert against the published numbers. See
[Phase 1 finding](#phase-1-finding-routing-aware-falls-back-to-greedy-on-this-targetcircuit-pair)
for the original fallback finding, and
[Phase 2a status](#phase-2a-status-297-heuristic-search-closes-the-fallback-gap)
for what changed once the heuristic landed. `QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE` remains
**unset by default** after #297 — Phase 2b's human sign-off has not happened
yet.

## Anchor row

[RAP] Table I, `ising`, n = 42 qubits:

| Metric | Routing-agnostic (ZAC-style baseline) | Routing-aware ([RAP]) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rearrangement steps | 22 | 9 |
| Rearrangement time | 3.1 ms | 1.6 ms |

Circuit pre-flight (both placer modes see the same circuit): **82** two-qubit
gates, **4** entangling layers. n = 98 (23 → 12 steps in the same table row
group) is **optional / local only, not CI** — the fixture (`test/na/ising_n98.qn`)
landed in #306, see [n = 98 (optional, local — landed by #306)](#n--98-optional-local--landed-by-306).
#306 also adds a repeatable local sweep harness over both rows × both placer
modes — see [Full sweep harness (#306)](#full-sweep-harness-306). Neither
addition changes what's hard-asserted in CI (still just `ising_n42`'s
structural pre-flight, per the locked Phase 1/2 split above).

## Metric mapping

| [RAP] Table I column | `quon_na` field | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rearrangement steps | `ResourceReport.rearrangement_steps` | Count of AOD-compatible movement groups emitted by [`schedule_zoned`](../../quon_na/src/zoned.rs) |
| Rearrangement time | `ResourceReport.rearrangement_time_us` | Sum of √-law **move-only** durations ([`movement_duration_us`](../../quon_na/src/zoned.rs)) per movement group — see [Timing model](#timing-model) for why this is deliberately *not* `rearrangement_time_us + transfer_time_us` |
| Two-qubit gate count (82) | `ResourceReport.entangle2_count` | Count of `Entangle2` schedule actions — one per circuit-level 2Q gate, placer-independent |
| Entangling layers (4) | `ResourceReport.rydberg_stages` | Count of distinct schedule layers containing an entangling action |
| *(not in the paper; #111 review instrumentation)* | `ResourceReport.aware_search_completed_layers` / `aware_search_fell_back_layers` | Per-layer count of whether [`assign_aware_legal`](../../quon_na/src/zoned.rs)'s best-first search found a full assignment within budget, or exhausted it and fell back to [`assign_greedy_legal`](../../quon_na/src/zoned.rs) — see [Phase 1 finding](#phase-1-finding-routing-aware-falls-back-to-greedy-on-this-targetcircuit-pair) |

`entangle2_count` and (for this specific fixture/target pairing — see next
section) `rydberg_stages` are **placer-independent pre-flight checks**: they
must hold before either placer's `rearrangement_steps`/`_time_us` are
compared to the paper. A wrong circuit (wrong gate count or wrong layer
structure) invalidates the whole comparison before it starts, so the
pre-flight test fails first and separately from the metric dump. The dump
test additionally hard-asserts both of these on **both** placers (not just
routing-agnostic), since a routing-aware-only circuit regression would
otherwise slip past the (agnostic-only, deliberately fast) pre-flight test.

## Timing model

[RAP] Sec. VI-B's rearrangement-time metric is `t = √(d/a) + 15 µs per
transfer`, with `a = 2750 m/s²` (literature_notes.md's [RAP] section). This is
the paper's √-law, **not** the newer jerk-limited timing model used by some
QMAP evaluation scripts (literature_notes.md's [RAP] caveats) — do not swap
the model to "match" QMAP tooling; that would stop reproducing *this* paper's
Table I.

**How this maps onto the two separate `ResourceReport` fields (#111 review
finding — an earlier draft of this doc conflated them):**

- `rearrangement_time_us` is **move-only**: the √-law duration
  ([`movement_duration_us`](../../quon_na/src/zoned.rs)) of each AOD-coupled
  movement group, summed across groups. It does **not** include any transfer
  overhead.
- `transfer_time_us` is a **separate aggregate**: `quon_na` emits one
  `Transfer` schedule action per atom per load and per store (so a
  two-atom movement group contributes 4 transfer actions), each with duration
  `arch.trap_transfer_us` (15 µs on this target). `ResourceReport::from_layers`
  *sums* those action durations — it is a rate×count-style aggregate (used
  for the physical error-budget, `movement × trap_transfers`), not a
  per-group wall-clock quantity. A `k`-atom group's transfer overhead is
  therefore counted here as `2k × 15 µs`, not the `2 × 15 µs` that a single
  simultaneous AOD load/store grab would cost in wall-clock time.

**Phase 1 decision (documented, not silently chosen): the paper comparison
uses `rearrangement_time_us` (move-only) only.** `rearrangement_time_us +
transfer_time_us` is *not* used as the comparison quantity, because
`transfer_time_us`'s per-atom-instance accounting (previous bullet) would
inflate the transfer contribution above what the paper's per-group `+15 µs
per transfer` term implies whenever a movement group has more than one atom
— that would make the comparison *less* honest, not more, despite looking
more "complete." The dump test's printed table reflects this: it labels the
compared column `time_us(move)` and prints `transfer_us` alongside only for
transparency, never folded into the paper comparison. Closing this gap
properly (a per-group wall-clock transfer field) is left to a follow-up;
Phase 1 does not hack around it by picking whichever quantity numerically
looks closer to the paper.

## Pre-flight fixture: `test/na/ising_n42.qn`

Hand-authored Quon (not vendored QASM), two Trotter-shaped steps of a
42-qubit nearest-neighbor chain. Each step's "ZZ layer" is split into two
explicit `for` loops — even bonds `(0,1)(2,3)…(40,41)` (21 gates, a perfect
matching), then odd bonds `(1,2)(3,4)…(39,40)` (20 gates, also a perfect
matching) — using native `CZ` gates (not `Rzz`, which would decompose to two
`CNOT`s per gate via `decompose_rzz` and double the count to 164). Full
rationale is in the file's header comment; the load-bearing fact is that
`quon_na`'s dependency-DAG ASAP scheduler assigns `dag_layer` by real
last-qubit-use (not textual/program order), so two gates that touch disjoint
qubits land in the same layer regardless of which `for` loop emitted them.
Two Trotter steps × (1 even layer + 1 odd layer) = 4 layers; 2 × (21 + 20) =
82 gates. Verified empirically against the compiled circuit — this is exactly
why the pre-flight test compiles the real `.qn` file rather than asserting
against a hand-rolled graph fixture.

Single-qubit `Rx` gates round out the Trotter shape but are invisible to
two-qubit interaction-graph extraction (`quon_na::extract`), so they cannot
perturb the 82/4 counts.

## Pinned target: `targets/neutral_atom/rap_table_i.json`

Byte-for-byte freeze of `targets/neutral_atom/generic_rna_v0.json` (same
zone geometry, movement model, timing, fidelity) except `id`. CI for this
regression loads `rap_table_i.json`, never `generic_rna_v0.json` — so tuning
the generic target for an unrelated purpose cannot silently move this
anchor's numbers. See
[`targets/neutral_atom/README.md`](../../targets/neutral_atom/README.md#rap_table_ijson-issue-111).

## Tests

`quonc/tests/rap_table_i.rs`:

- `ising_n42_preflight_gate_and_layer_counts` — **not** `#[ignore]`d; part of
  the default `cargo test --workspace` / `just ci-rust` gate. Compiles
  `test/na/ising_n42.qn` against `rap_table_i.json` with the (fast) default
  routing-agnostic placer and asserts `entangle2_count == 82` and
  `rydberg_stages == 4`. For this fixture/target pairing there is no
  placement-induced deferral (ample entanglement-zone capacity, no spacing
  conflicts), so the post-placement `rydberg_stages` here equals the
  circuit's own dependency-DAG layer count — the same placer-independent
  quantity either mode would report. Fails first, before any placer
  comparison, if the circuit or target regresses.
- `ising_n42_dumps_both_placer_rearrangement_metrics` — `#[ignore]`d (see
  [Runtime](#runtime--ci-wiring) below). Runs `schedule_zoned` via `quonc`
  under both `--na-placer routing-agnostic` and `--na-placer routing-aware`,
  prints a comparison table (steps, move-only time, transfer time,
  ×-agnostic-over-aware ratio, aware search completed/fell-back status) to
  stdout, and:
  - **Hard, regardless of `QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE`** (structural — under
    `just ci-rust`'s `set -euo pipefail` these are what actually gate CI, per
    the #111 review): `entangle2_count == 82` and `rydberg_stages == 4` on
    **both** placers (not just agnostic — closing the gap the fast
    agnostic-only pre-flight test above deliberately leaves open), and the
    routing-aware search's `aware_search_completed_layers` /
    `aware_search_fell_back_layers` diagnostic fields are present and
    internally consistent (agnostic reports `(0, 0)`; aware reports at least
    one outcome). Prints a `FALLBACK` banner (not a failure — Phase 1 stays
    soft on the *numeric* mismatch, see below) whenever
    `aware_search_fell_back_layers > 0`.
  - **Soft (`QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE` unset or not `1`):** never fails on a
    numeric mismatch against the published row. Prints a `WARNING` banner
    (not a failure) if aware is not at least as good as agnostic, since
    [RAP]'s whole point is a meaningful aware improvement.
  - **`QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE=1` (Phase 2, after human sign-off):** hard
    tolerance asserts — see [Tolerances](#tolerances-for-phase-2-enforcement).

`quon_na/src/zoned.rs`'s `mod tests` additionally has
`aware_search_completes_and_beats_greedy_on_contended_pairs` — a small
(2-gate, 2-pair, hand-constructed positions), fixture-independent unit test
proving the aware search mechanism itself (not this specific 42-qubit
circuit) can both **complete** (`AwareSearchOutcome::Completed`, not a
fallback) and find a strictly better joint assignment than the greedy
placer on a genuinely contended layout, plus (added by #297)
`aware_search_completes_and_beats_greedy_at_ising_n42_scale` — the same
contention shape replicated across 10 well-separated clusters (20 gates, 340
candidate pairs total, matching `ising_n42`'s real per-layer scale) to prove
the mechanism holds up at fixture scale, not only in the tiny 2-gate case.
This is the evidence backing the
[Phase 1 finding](#phase-1-finding-routing-aware-falls-back-to-greedy-on-this-targetcircuit-pair)'s
claim that the `ising_n42` gap is plausibly budget/scaling, not "nothing to
find."

`ising_n98_preflight_and_dump_metrics` (#306) is the n = 98 companion to
`ising_n42_dumps_both_placer_rearrangement_metrics`, combined with its own
structural pre-flight into a single `#[ignore]`d test (no fast/un-ignored
split, since n = 98 is not a CI anchor at all — see
[n = 98](#n--98-optional-local--landed-by-306)). No `QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE`
equivalent exists for it.

### Runtime / CI wiring

Routing-aware placement is an A* search
([`assign_aware_legal`](../../quon_na/src/zoned.rs), default budget
`AwareSearchParams::node_budget = AWARE_NODE_BUDGET = 100_000`
expansions/layer, per-run configurable as of #297 — see
[Phase 2a status](#phase-2a-status-297-heuristic-search-closes-the-fallback-gap))
over this target's 340 entanglement-zone pairs. Measured on this fixture
post-#297: routing-agnostic ≈ 1 s, routing-aware ≈ 2–12 s in a `--release`
build depending on which parameters are exercised (pre-#297: routing-aware
was 90–125 s, always exhausting its full budget on every layer without
completing — see the [Phase 1 finding](#phase-1-finding-routing-aware-falls-back-to-greedy-on-this-targetcircuit-pair)
for that superseded measurement). Even at the improved speed this is still
too slow for the default `cargo test --workspace` gate (which runs in debug
mode, substantially slower again), so the dump test remains `#[ignore]`d.

**Correction (#306 review — a prior draft of this section was stale/wrong):**
the `just rap-table-i` recipe
(`cargo test --release -p quonc --test rap_table_i -- --include-ignored --nocapture`)
is a **local-only convenience recipe** — checked directly against
`Justfile` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` while implementing #306, neither
`ci-rust` nor any CI job actually invokes it. Only
`ising_n42_preflight_gate_and_layer_counts` (the fast, un-ignored test) runs
in CI today, as part of `cargo test --workspace` inside `ci-rust`'s `rust`
job. So "n=42 in CI" currently means the *structural* 82/4 pre-flight only —
the slower metric-dump comparison against the published 22/9 / 3.1/1.6ms row
is **not** automatically re-run by CI; a human/agent must run `just
rap-table-i` locally to regenerate it. Re-wiring the dump test into a CI job
(the Justfile's own comment on `rap-table-i` already flags this as "a
reasonable follow-up, left out of #297's scope") remains exactly that: an
open follow-up, not something #306 changes. #306's own `na-rap-sweep` recipe
(below) follows the *same* local-only precedent deliberately, for the same
reason (wall time), not because CI wiring was judged unnecessary.

```bash
# Local-only — NOT invoked by any CI job (see justfile's `rap-table-i` recipe
# and the correction above)
cargo test --release -p quonc --test rap_table_i -- --include-ignored --nocapture

# Fast pre-flight only (part of the default gate)
cargo test -p quonc --test rap_table_i preflight
```

## Phase 1 finding: routing-aware falls back to greedy on this target/circuit pair

**Superseded by #297 (kept as historical record — see
[Phase 2a status](#phase-2a-status-297-heuristic-search-closes-the-fallback-gap)
below for the current numbers and mechanism).** This section describes the
uniform-cost (`h = 0`) search's behavior *before* the Eqs. (3)-(5) heuristic
existed; `aware_search_fell_back_layers` is `0`, not `4`, as of #297.

**Corrected finding (#111 review; an earlier draft of this doc claimed "no
routing contention" — that claim was wrong and has been retracted).** Measured
on `rap_table_i.json` (default row-major initial placement), including the
new `aware_search_completed_layers` / `aware_search_fell_back_layers`
instrumentation:

| Placer | Rearrangement steps | Rearrangement time_us (move-only) | Rydberg stages | Entangle2 count | Aware search |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Routing-agnostic | 23 | 3049 | 4 | 82 | n/a |
| Routing-aware | 23 | 3049 | 4 | 82 | **0 of 4 layers completed; 4 of 4 fell back to greedy** |

Both placers produce **identical** schedules — but *not* because there is "no
routing contention." The routing-aware `assign_aware_legal` search
([`quon_na/src/zoned.rs`](../../quon_na/src/zoned.rs)) exhausted its
`AWARE_NODE_BUDGET` (100,000 expansions/layer) on **all four** of this
circuit's entangling layers and fell back to `assign_greedy_legal` every
single time, per the instrumentation added in the #111 review fix — so
routing-aware's output on this fixture is, byte-for-byte, greedy's output.
That is the actual mechanism, and it is unsurprising in retrospect: the
search is uniform-cost (`h = 0`, [RAP] Sec. IV-B's inadmissible heuristic is
not implemented — see the [Tests](#tests) / follow-up notes), each of this
circuit's four layers has 20–21 simultaneous gates, and this target's
entanglement zone offers 340 candidate pairs — the reachable state space per
layer is astronomically larger than 100,000 uniform-cost expansions, so the
search **never gets close to finishing** before the budget cap fires.

This means the earlier "no routing contention, greedy already optimal"
framing was an unverified guess dressed up as a finding: with the search
never completing, there was no way to know whether an *exhaustive* aware
search would have beaten greedy here — only that the *budget-limited* search
didn't. [`aware_search_completes_and_beats_greedy_on_contended_pairs`](../../quon_na/src/zoned.rs)
(a new, tiny, non-fixture-dependent unit test added in the #111 review fix)
demonstrates the search mechanism itself *can* find a strictly better joint
assignment than greedy when it completes — so the gap on `ising_n42` is
plausibly a **budget/scaling** problem on this fixture, not a "there was
nothing to find" problem, though Phase 1 stops short of proving that for this
specific 21-gate/340-pair layer (that would require either a real heuristic
so the search terminates in reasonable time, or raising the budget and
re-measuring, both left to Phase 2 / a follow-up).

**This is exactly the kind of judgment call Phase 2 human sign-off exists
for** — before enabling `QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE=1`, a human must decide how
to close this gap: a real A* heuristic (Eqs. (3)–(5), not yet implemented),
a larger budget, a tighter entanglement-zone geometry, or some combination —
and whether the result still counts as reproducing [RAP]'s *mechanism*.
Phase 1's contract is only to make the fallback **visible** (the dump test
now hard-asserts the diagnostic fields are present and prints a `FALLBACK`
banner whenever `aware_search_fell_back_layers > 0`), not to fix it.

## Phase 2a status (#297): heuristic search closes the fallback gap

Implements [RAP] Sec. IV-C / V-C's guiding heuristic (Eqs. (3)–(5)) and Sec.
V-D's pruning, turning `assign_aware_legal` from a uniform-cost (`h = 0`)
search into true A*. Measured on `rap_table_i.json` / `ising_n42.qn` with the
implementation's chosen defaults (see below):

| Placer | Rearrangement steps | Rearrangement time_us (move-only) | Rydberg stages | Entangle2 count | Aware search |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Routing-agnostic | 23 | 3049 | 4 | 82 | n/a |
| Routing-aware | 18 | 2999 | 4 | 82 | **4 of 4 layers completed; 0 of 4 fell back** |

`aware_search_fell_back_layers == 0` — the acceptance criterion this section
exists to demonstrate. Routing-aware now genuinely beats routing-agnostic on
both headline columns (18 vs 23 steps, −22%; 2999 vs 3049 µs move-only time,
−2%) via a completed search, not a coincidental tie through fallback (the
Phase 1 finding above). This is a real, human-verifiable improvement, but it
is **not** [RAP]'s published 9-step/1.6 ms row for this same benchmark — see
[Divergences from the paper's numbers](#divergences-from-the-papers-numbers-post-297)
below for why, and why closing that remaining gap further is left to Phase 2b
/ a follow-up rather than asserted here.

**What changed in `assign_aware_legal` (`quon_na/src/zoned.rs`):**

- **Eq. (1) grouping moved into the search itself.** Before #297, each
  node's cost was the sum of every gate's own `√d_max` independently — it did
  not group moves into AOD-compatible movement groups the way the post-search
  router (`partition_aod_compatible`) actually does, so the search's notion of
  "cheap" did not match what routing would really charge. `assign_aware_legal`
  now maintains the same grouping ([`positions_aod_compatible`]) incrementally
  per node, so `cost_so_far` is exact Eq. (1) cost, not a proxy. (This is also
  why the pre-#297 unit test `aware_cost_not_worse_than_agnostic_on_matching`
  keeps passing unchanged — it already only asserted an inequality, not exact
  numbers.)
- **Eq. (3)-(4) heuristic.** Admissible part: `max(0, √(max distance among
  unplaced gates' nearest still-legal pair) − √(current largest group
  distance))`. Accelerating part: `δ · (β + Σ_G SD(G)) · |unplaced|`, where
  `SD(G)` is computed on **discrete ranks** of each group's source/target
  coordinates (matching the paper's own discretization, Sec. V-A/V-C/Example
  9), not raw µm displacement — an earlier draft used raw displacement
  directly and a #297 review pass caught it blowing the heuristic up
  (hundreds of µm-scale "spurious" penalty) whenever one group member's move
  happened to be physically much longer than another's, even in perfectly
  legal, uniform-in-the-only-sense-that-matters groups. Eq. (5)'s cross-layer
  look-ahead term is **not** implemented — this module's search only decides
  gate→pair assignment within one layer (no atom-by-atom intermediate/storage
  placement across layers), so there is no "next gate's partner" to look
  ahead to without a larger restructuring; documented scope reduction, see
  `quon_na::zoned`'s module doc.
- **Sec. V-D pruning window.** Bounds each gate's considered candidates per
  node to the nearest `pruning_window` *legal* pairs (scanned from the full
  legal set, so a gate is never denied a choice purely because a closer
  *illegal* pair occupied a window slot). This does **not** preserve full
  completeness, despite an earlier draft of this doc claiming otherwise: if
  the only full legal assignment for a layer requires some gate to take a
  choice outside its window, that assignment is never generated, and the
  search can report `NoLegalAssignment` even though a full legal assignment
  exists — a real, intentional gap in the same tradeoff spirit as beam width
  below, not observed to matter on the `ising_n42` anchor fixture at
  `window = 32` (0 fallbacks either way), but not a proof either.
- **Beam width (engineering addition, not a paper term).** The single
  largest lever, empirically: without a frontier cap, the priority queue at
  `ising_n42` scale (20-21 simultaneous gates, 340 candidate pairs, real
  crosstalk conflicts among physically adjacent entanglement-zone pairs —
  `min_rydberg_spacing_um = 18.75` vs. pair pitch `(12, 10)` µm, so *most*
  geometrically-adjacent pairs are mutually illegal) filled with a huge
  number of shallow (early-gate) alternatives that all looked similarly cheap
  under the heuristic, and 100,000 expansions were spent almost entirely
  widening rather than deepening the search — verified by instrumentation
  showing the frontier reaching 1M+ queued nodes while still stuck below half
  depth on a 20-21-gate layer. Trimming the frontier back to the best
  `beam_width` nodes whenever it exceeds `2 × beam_width` forces the search to
  commit to promising partial placements instead. This is standard beam
  search, not a departure from the paper's *legality* semantics — only from
  its (unspecified, C++-implementation-only) search-loop mechanics.

**Chosen parameter values (`AwareSearchParams::default()`,
`quon_na/src/zoned.rs`):**

| Parameter | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deepening_factor` (δ) | 0.6 | [RAP] Sec. VI-A QASMBench set — `ising_n42` is itself a QASMBench benchmark (Table I's `ising2` row) |
| `deepening_value` (β) | 0.2 | [RAP] Sec. VI-A QASMBench set |
| `node_budget` | 100,000 | Unchanged from the pre-#297 `AWARE_NODE_BUDGET` constant; still the default, now genuinely sufficient with the heuristic + beam width rather than always being exhausted |
| `pruning_window` | 32 | Chosen empirically (see below) to balance branching factor against solution quality; qmap's own window size was not discoverable from the parts of `HeuristicPlacer` fetched during implementation |
| `beam_width` | 2,000 | Chosen empirically — swept 500 / 1,000 / 2,000 / 3,000 / 4,000 / 5,000 on this exact fixture; 2,000 was the smallest value (fastest, least risk of ever needing the budget) that still gave the best steps/time pair among values that completed all 4 layers within `node_budget` |

α (Eq. (2)'s look-ahead weight) and γ (Eq. (2)'s reuse-cost offset) have no
field in `AwareSearchParams` — see the "Eq. (5)" bullet above for why the
cross-layer look-ahead term they belong to is out of scope for this port.

Configurable via [`quon_na::pipeline::NaScheduleOptions::aware_search`] (a
per-run option, not baked into the target JSON) — matching qmap's own
`Config`-passed-to-the-placer-per-call shape rather than the architecture
description. Threaded through `schedule_zoned_with_aware_params` (the
original 3-argument `schedule_zoned` is now a thin wrapper defaulting to
`AwareSearchParams::default()`, so no existing call site needed to change).

### Divergences from the paper's numbers (post-#297)

18/2999 vs. the paper's 9/1600 is a real, substantial gap. Contributing
factors, in believed order of impact (not independently verified against
qmap's own numbers — a follow-up could re-run qmap on an equivalent circuit
to isolate these):

- **This crate's search only reassigns entanglement-zone placement, not
  storage-zone (intermediate) placement.** The paper's placement stage makes
  *both* a gate placement (this crate's scope) and an intermediate placement
  (returning non-reused atoms to storage) part of the same joint search, with
  reuse/look-ahead cost terms connecting them across layers (Eq. (2)). This
  crate's storage-zone return uses whatever position an atom already has
  (reuse only when it's an exact repeat), never re-optimizing storage
  placement — a materially smaller search space than the paper's.
- **No cross-layer look-ahead (Eq. (5)),** as discussed above — placements
  are locally good per-layer but don't anticipate the *next* layer's
  requirements, which is exactly the mechanism the paper credits for its
  best results (its Example 2 / Sec. IV-A).
- **Beam width trades completeness for speed** more aggressively than
  qmap's presumably-larger default budget (the issue's own brief cites qmap's
  default as 50M nodes — three orders of magnitude above this
  implementation's 100,000, though not apples-to-apples once beam width is
  in the picture too).
- **Parameter values are the QASMBench set from the paper's Table I**, but
  qmap's actual per-parameter search (its Sec. VI-A parameter study, Fig. 10)
  was not reproduced here — a wider sweep, or the MQT Bench parameter set
  (`α=0.2, β=0.8, γ=5, δ=0.9`) worth trying for comparison, is a reasonable
  Phase 2b follow-up.

None of this changes the Phase 2a headline claim — `aware_search_fell_back_layers
== 0`, and routing-aware genuinely, non-coincidentally beats routing-agnostic
on this fixture now — but a human should read this section before deciding
whether 18/2999 (vs. published 9/1600) counts as close enough to flip
`QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE=1`, and at what tolerance.

## Tolerances (for Phase 2 enforcement)

Locked decisions (implemented behind the enforce flag; **off by default** in
Phase 1):

- **±2 steps** on each placer's `rearrangement_steps` vs its published value
  (22 agnostic / 9 aware).
- **±10%** on each placer's `rearrangement_time_us` vs its published value
  (3.1 ms agnostic / 1.6 ms aware).
- **Meaningful aware improvement**: aware must beat agnostic by a documented
  relative floor (not just `<`), reflecting [RAP]'s reported −59% steps /
  −49% time story. The exact floor wired today is whatever
  `rap_table_i.rs` encodes; Phase 2 may revise it after human sign-off.

`QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE=1` is read by
`ising_n42_dumps_both_placer_rearrangement_metrics`. The ±2 / ±10% / floor
asserts are **already implemented** in that test — they are not stubs or
no-ops. With the flag unset (CI default), those numeric asserts are skipped
and only the dump + structural checks run. With the flag set to `1` today,
the test **will hard-fail** on this fixture because routing-aware still falls
back to greedy on every layer (23/23 steps, no paper delta) — see the finding
above. Do **not** enable the flag in CI until Phase 2 human sign-off closes
the mechanism gap (real A* / larger budget / tighter geometry / etc.).

## n = 98 (optional, local — landed by #306)

[RAP] Table I also reports `ising` n = 98: 23 → 12 rearrangement steps.
**Still not a CI row** (issue #111's locked decision, reaffirmed by #306) —
but the fixture this section originally anticipated is now checked in:
`test/na/ising_n98.qn`, the same even/odd `for`-loop construction as
`ising_n42.qn` scaled to `n = 98` (49 even-group gates, 48 odd-group gates
per step; header comment has the full rationale). It shares the same pinned
`rap_table_i.json` target as n42. Structural pre-flight (placer-independent):
**194** two-qubit gates over **4** entangling layers (2 × (49 + 48)), verified
by compiling the fixture, same discipline as n42's 82/4.

**Measured** (this repo, `--release`, default `AwareSearchParams` — the same
values documented in [Phase 2a status](#phase-2a-status-297-heuristic-search-closes-the-fallback-gap)
above, tuned empirically on `ising_n42`, *not* re-tuned for this larger
fixture):

| Placer | Rearrangement steps | Rearrangement time_us (move-only) | Rydberg stages | Entangle2 count | Aware search |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Routing-agnostic | 48 | 8896 | 4 | 194 | n/a |
| Routing-aware | 48 | 8896 | 4 | 194 | **0 of 4 layers completed; 4 of 4 fell back to greedy** |

Both placers produce **identical** output here — this is the *same fallback
mechanism* as the pre-#297 [Phase 1 finding](#phase-1-finding-routing-aware-falls-back-to-greedy-on-this-targetcircuit-pair)
above, just now surfacing at n = 98's larger scale instead of n = 42's.
`--emit-na-stats` (#307) shows why: `aware_search_node_expansions` reaches
`400004` against a `node_budget` of `100000` — the search hits its expansion
cap on every layer. `ising_n98`'s layers have up to 49 simultaneous gates
(vs. n42's 20-21) over the same 340-candidate-pair entanglement zone, so the
per-layer search space is far larger while `node_budget` (100,000) and
`beam_width` (2,000) — both chosen empirically *on `ising_n42`* in #297 — are
unchanged. Neither parameter is exposed as a `quonc` CLI flag today (only
[`quon_na::pipeline::NaScheduleOptions::aware_search`] as a library-level
option), so this sweep could not simply pass a larger budget without a code
change; re-tuning (or exposing) those parameters for larger circuits is left
as a Phase 2b / follow-up question, not attempted here. Net result: this
repo's measured 48/48 steps is **not** comparable to [RAP]'s published 23/12
for this row — the gap is dominated by the aware search never completing at
this scale, on top of the same structural divergences from the paper already
documented in [Divergences from the paper's numbers](#divergences-from-the-papers-numbers-post-297)
(no storage-zone re-placement, no cross-layer look-ahead, beam-limited
search). [RAP] does not publish a rearrangement-*time* figure for the n = 98
row (only the step counts), so there is no published `time_us` to compare
against either.

Exercised by `quonc/tests/rap_table_i.rs`'s `ising_n98_preflight_and_dump_metrics`
(`#[ignore]`d — see [Tests](#tests)) and by the full sweep harness added in
#306 — see [Full sweep harness (#306)](#full-sweep-harness-306) below. No
`QUON_RAP_TABLE_I_ENFORCE`-style flag exists for this row; it is dump-only
with no Phase 2 plan, since it was never a CI anchor to begin with.

## Full sweep harness (#306)

Issue #306 adds a repeatable local/nightly sweep over every checked-in RAP
Table I row (currently: `ising_n42`, `ising_n98`) × both `--na-placer` modes,
producing one CSV: `python/na_rap_table_i_sweep.py` (run via `just
na-rap-sweep`). Wall time on this fixture set, `--release`,
measured end to end: **≈20-25 s total** (`ising_n42` agnostic ≈0.2 s, aware
≈4.8-4.9 s; `ising_n98` agnostic ≈0.2-0.25 s, aware ≈16-19.4 s — dominated by
the same budget-exhausting search described above). This is well past what
the default `cargo test --workspace` gate should carry, so — mirroring
`rap-table-i`'s own existing precedent immediately above in the Justfile —
`na-rap-sweep` is **not** wired into `just ci-rust`'s hosted-runner gate; it
stays a documented local/nightly convenience recipe.

**Scope: #304 (QASM ingestion) is not implemented.** [RAP] Table I's full
benchmark set (Sec. VI-A) includes several QASMBench/MQT Bench circuits at
multiple qubit counts beyond the `ising` rows (see
[`literature_notes.md`](./literature_notes.md#rap--stade-lin-cong-wille-iccad-2025-arxiv250522715--the-reproduced-paper)'s
"[RAP]" section). Quon has no QASM *ingestion* path today (only OpenQASM
*emission*, for fixed targets) — issue #304 tracks building one, and it is
**out of scope for #306**. The sweep therefore covers only the two
hand-authored `ising` rows; it does **not** attempt to fabricate or
approximate the paper's other benchmark rows. Closing this gap is entirely
gated on #304 landing first.

CSV columns reuse `ResourceReport` / `NaStats` field names (this repo's own
convention — matches `python/quon_qec_benchmarks.py`) rather than qmap's
exact headers, since the two tools' internals differ enough that a literal
rename would misrepresent some columns (e.g. quon's `rearrangement_time_us`
is move-only √-law time, see [Timing model](#timing-model) above; qmap's
`rearrangement_duration` uses a jerk-limited model). A `circuit_name` column
(qmap's own primary-key column name, e.g. `ising_n42`) is included verbatim
for easy joining, and the script's module docstring documents the full
quon-column ↔ qmap-column mapping — fetched from qmap's
`eval/na/zoned/eval_ids_relaxed_routing.py` `print_header()` while building
this script (not independently verified by running qmap itself; see next
paragraph). A side-by-side comparison notebook should rename/join on that
documented mapping rather than assume identical headers.

**Direct mqt-qmap comparison: not attempted.** Installing and running
mqt-qmap (a full Python package with its own native build) in this sandboxed
environment was judged nontrivial relative to its value for #306 — this is
explicitly optional per the issue and is left as a follow-up. The
qmap-recognizable column naming above is the mitigation for now.

## Distinct from QEC benchmarks (#254)

The QEC compiler-ablation harness (`python/quon_qec_benchmarks.py`,
[`qec_benchmark_methodology.md`](./qec_benchmark_methodology.md)) reuses
RAP-style headline field *names* (rearrangement time, Rydberg stages, …) as a
**methodology style** only. QEC CSV rows are tagged
`methodology_anchor=issue_111_rap_table_i_physical_na_only` precisely so they
are never mistaken for a Table I numeric claim — see
`qec_benchmark_methodology.md`'s "Experiment class" table and
`literature_notes.md`'s "[RAP] Caveats for the reproduction" for the existing
do-not-conflate language this doc extends. Nothing in #254 reports or should
report the 22/9 or 82/4 numbers above; only `rap_table_i.json` +
`ising_n42.qn` do.
